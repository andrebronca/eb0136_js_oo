//WeakMap and WeakSet

/*
WeakMap only supports the new, has(), get(), set(), and delete() methods
WeakSet only supports new, has(), add(), and delete()
Keys of a WeakMap must be objects
Values of a WeakSet must be objects
You can't iterate over WeakMap; the only way you can access a value is via its key
You can't iterate over a WeakSet
You can't clear a WeakMap or a WeakSet
